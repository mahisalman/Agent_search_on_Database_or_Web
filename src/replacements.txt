# API tokens have been moved to environment variables for security
# This file previously contained token replacements but is now used for documentation

# Security Notice:
# - All API tokens are now loaded from environment variables
# - Use env_setup.py to configure your API keys
# - Never commit hardcoded tokens to version control
# - Use .env files for local development (add to .gitignore)

# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Run: python env_setup.py
# 2. Or set environment variables manually:
#    export GITHUB_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
#    export TAVILY_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# For production deployment:
# - Use secure secret management systems
# - Implement proper access controls
# - Monitor for token usage and anomalies
# - Regularly rotate API keys
